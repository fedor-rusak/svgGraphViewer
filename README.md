# svgGraphViewer idea

[![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Simple (fresh JS, SVG support required) web-page that contains all necessary JS to show and interact with nodes and edges of some default graph data.

## Instructions

Just open [svgGraphViewer.html](svgGraphViewer.html) in your browser to start application.

## Goal

Have a page with functionality that can be adapted to specific case. Like add specific shapes, colors, behaviors and etc without learning new super fancy API.

## Technical decisions

* Custom graph data structure implementation (TO-DO)
* Listeners as basis for interactivity (TO-DO)
* SVG as main way to render things (TO-DO)
